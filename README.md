# base16-termux
[Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for the [Termux](https://github.com/termux/) terminal emulator app for Android.

# Installation
Simply your desired color scheme into your Termux environment as `~/.termux/colors.properties`. If there is no `.termux`, create it with `mkdir .termux`.

# `256` Variants

The 256 variants are for those who wish to continue using the 16 ANSI colors but don't want to end up with weird-looking colors instead of bright ones. Because base16 schemes have 16 colors only, the bright colors mirror their non-bright variants instead of being unique colors.

### TL;DR if some colors look weird, darker than normal, or incorrect, try the `256` variant.
